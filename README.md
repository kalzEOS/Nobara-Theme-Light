This is the Nobara official theme. I have only modified the styling code to make it light-grayish. There is a folder and a file. The folder "Nobara Light" is the ``desktoptheme``, the one that colors the panel and the applications menu..etc.
It needs to be in ``/usr/share/plasma/desktoptheme``.

Then there is the file called ``NobaraModifiedLight.colors``, this one needs to either go in ``/.local/share/color-schemes`` if you want it for the user only, or in ``/usr/share/color-schemes`` for system wide installation.

Make sure to change the icons to the papirus light ones. 

You could also change the applications menu icon to a dark Nobara logo (or anything you would like).

I have also noticed that the ``Nobara package manager`` icon is almost invisible (first screenshot). I just changed it from the ``.desktop`` file of the app. Go to ``/usr/share/applications/``. Find ``dk.yumex.Yumex.desktop``. Right click and open it with kate. Replace ``Icon=nobara.package.manager``
With ``Icon=/PATH-TO-YOUR-DOWNLOADED/FAVORIT-ICON``

Enjoy
